# Mercado Libre Integration

Connect your Mercado Libre seller account with ZenFlow to automatically import orders, sync inventory, and update order statuses.

<Note>
  This integration supports Mercado Libre accounts in Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, Chile, Uruguay, and Peru. **Includes support for MercadoShops** as an additional channel.
</Note>

## Supported Channels

This integration includes support for:

- **Mercado Libre** - Main marketplace
- **MercadoShops** - Your own online store within the Mercado Libre ecosystem

Both channels are managed from the same integration. MercadoShops orders are automatically imported alongside Mercado Libre orders.

### Orders Not Importing

<Accordion title="Check connection status">
  Go to **Settings** > **Integrations** and verify your Mercado Libre account shows as "Connected". If disconnected, re-authorize the connection.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Verify webhook configuration">
  Mercado Libre webhooks should be automatically configured. If orders are missing, try manually syncing orders for the affected date range.
</Accordion>

### Inventory Not Updating

<Accordion title="Check product mapping">
  Ensure your products are correctly mapped between ZenFlow and Mercado Libre SKUs.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Verify sync settings">
  Check that inventory sync is enabled in your integration settings.
</Accordion>

## Rate Limits

Mercado Libre enforces API rate limits:

| Endpoint Type | Limit |
|---------------|-------|
| Orders | 10,000 requests/hour |
| Items | 10,000 requests/hour |
| Inventory | 3,000 requests/hour |

ZenFlow automatically handles rate limiting and retries.
