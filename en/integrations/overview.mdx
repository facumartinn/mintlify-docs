## How Integrations Work

### 1. Connect Your Account

Link your e-commerce platform account to ZenFlow through OAuth or API credentials.

### 2. Configure Sync Settings

Choose what to sync:
- **Orders**: Automatically import new orders for fulfillment
- **Products**: Keep your catalog synchronized
- **Inventory**: Real-time stock level updates

### 3. Automatic Synchronization

Once connected, ZenFlow handles everything:
- New orders are imported automatically
- Order status updates are pushed back to the platform
- Inventory levels are kept in sync
