## Webhook Events

ZenFlow automatically receives these webhooks from WooCommerce:

| Topic | Description | ZenFlow Action |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| `order.created` | New order created | Imports if status is "processing" |
| `order.updated` | Order updated | Updates status in ZenFlow |
| `order.deleted` | Order deleted | Marks as cancelled |

<Note>
  Webhooks are automatically registered in WooCommerce when you connect your store.
</Note>

## Product Mapping

### Automatic Matching

When an order is imported, ZenFlow attempts to match products automatically:

1. Looks for existing mapping by `wc_product_id` + `wc_variation_id`
2. If not found, searches by **SKU** in ZenFlow catalog
3. If found by SKU, creates the mapping automatically

### Manual Mapping

For products that don't auto-match:

1. Go to **Integrations** > **WooCommerce** > **Product Mapping**
2. Filter by "Unmapped"
3. Select the corresponding ZenFlow product

### Variable Products

Each WooCommerce variation maps to a separate product in ZenFlow:

| WooCommerce | ZenFlow |
|-------------|---------|
| T-Shirt (Size: S, Color: Blue) | TSHIRT-S-BLUE |
| T-Shirt (Size: M, Color: Blue) | TSHIRT-M-BLUE |
| T-Shirt (Size: L, Color: Blue) | TSHIRT-L-BLUE |

## Status Mapping

| WooCommerce Status | ZenFlow Status |
|--------------------|----------------|
| `pending` | Pending |
| `processing` | Ready to pick |
| `on-hold` | Pending |
| `completed` | Completed |
| `cancelled` | Cancelled |
| `refunded` | Cancelled |
| `failed` | Cancelled |

## Troubleshooting

### Cannot Connect

<Accordion title="Check store URL">
  Make sure to use the correct URL including `https://`. The URL must be publicly accessible.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Check API credentials">
  Consumer Key and Secret must have Read/Write permissions. Generate new credentials if needed.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Check SSL">
  WooCommerce requires HTTPS for the REST API. Make sure your site has a valid SSL certificate.
</Accordion>

### Orders Not Importing

<Accordion title="Check order status">
  By default, only orders with "Processing" status are imported. Orders in "Pending" or "On-hold" are not imported automatically.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Check webhooks">
  Go to **WooCommerce** > **Settings** > **Advanced** > **Webhooks** and verify that ZenFlow webhooks are active.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Check sync configuration">
  Make sure `sync_orders` is enabled in the integration settings.
</Accordion>

### Stock Not Syncing

<Accordion title="Check product mapping">
  The product must be properly mapped. Verify a mapping exists in **Product Mapping**.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Check sync flag">
  Each mapping has a `sync_stock` flag. Make sure it's enabled.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Check stock management in WC">
  In WooCommerce, the product must have "Manage stock" enabled for ZenFlow to update quantities.
</Accordion>

## Rate Limits

| Operation | Limit |
