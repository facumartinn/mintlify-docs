## Webhook Payload

All webhook payloads follow this structure:

```json
{
  "id": "evt_abc123",
  "event": "order.created",
  "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "data": {
    // Event-specific data
  }
}
```

## Security

Webhooks are signed using HMAC-SHA256. Verify the signature in the `X-Webhook-Signature` header:

```
t=1705312200,v1=5d4b8c7a...
```

See [Webhooks Guide](/guides/webhooks#verifying-webhooks) for verification code examples.
