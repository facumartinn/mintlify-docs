## Webhook Events

ZenFlow receives these events from Tiendanube:

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `order/created` | New order placed |
| `order/paid` | Order payment confirmed |
| `order/fulfilled` | Order marked as shipped |
| `order/cancelled` | Order cancelled |
| `product/created` | New product added |
| `product/updated` | Product details changed |

## Product Mapping

### Automatic Matching

ZenFlow tries to match products automatically using:
1. SKU (exact match)
2. Barcode / EAN
3. Product name (fuzzy match)

### Manual Mapping

For products that can't be matched automatically:

1. Go to **Integrations** > **Tiendanube** > **Product Mapping**
2. View unmatched products
3. Select the corresponding ZenFlow product for each

```json
{
  "mappings": [
    {
      "tiendanube_product_id": "12345",
      "tiendanube_variant_id": "67890",
      "zenflow_product_id": 100,
      "zenflow_sku": "PROD-001"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Multi-variant Products

For products with variants (size, color, etc.):

- Each variant maps to a separate ZenFlow product
- Stock is tracked per variant
- Orders include variant-specific details

Example mapping:
| Tiendanube | ZenFlow |
|------------|---------|
| T-Shirt (S) | TSHIRT-S |
| T-Shirt (M) | TSHIRT-M |
| T-Shirt (L) | TSHIRT-L |

## Troubleshooting

### Orders Not Syncing

<Accordion title="Verify webhook configuration">
  Check that Tiendanube webhooks are properly configured. Go to your Tiendanube admin panel > Apps > ZenFlow to verify the connection.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Check order status filter">
  By default, only "paid" orders are imported. Adjust your settings if you need to import orders in other states.
</Accordion>

### Inventory Mismatch

<Accordion title="Check sync direction">
  Verify your sync direction setting. If set to "ZenFlow -> Tiendanube", changes in Tiendanube won't update ZenFlow.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Force full sync">
  Use the "Full Sync" option to reconcile all inventory levels.
</Accordion>

### Product Not Found

<Accordion title="Check SKU matching">
  Ensure the product SKU in Tiendanube matches exactly with ZenFlow (case-sensitive).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Enable auto-create">
  Enable "Create missing products" to automatically add new products from Tiendanube.
</Accordion>

## Rate Limits

| Operation | Limit |
|-----------|-------|
| API calls | 2 requests/second |
| Bulk operations | 100 items/request |

ZenFlow handles rate limiting automatically with exponential backoff.
