## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

```
https://api.zenflow.com/api/v1
```

## Authentication

ZenFlow API uses API Keys for authentication. Include your API key in the `X-API-Key` header:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.zenflow.com/api/v1/orders" \
  -H "X-API-Key: zenflow_live_your_api_key_here"
```

<Note>
  API keys are scoped to specific permissions. Make sure your key has the required scopes for the endpoints you want to use.
</Note>

## Response Format

All responses are returned in JSON format with a consistent structure:

### Success Response

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    // Response data here
  }
}
```

### Error Response

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "error_code",
    "message": "Human readable error message"
  }
}
```

## Rate Limits

API requests are rate limited based on your API key configuration:

| Limit Type | Default |
|------------|---------|
| Per Minute | 60 requests |
| Per Hour | 1,000 requests |
| Per Day | 10,000 requests |

Rate limit headers are included in all responses:

- `X-RateLimit-Limit`: Maximum requests allowed
- `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: Requests remaining
- `X-RateLimit-Reset`: Unix timestamp when the limit resets
